# Prepare land use change data --------------------------------------------

# Read in TIF raster files from "data/landsat", merge them with the SHP map
# of political boundaries found in "data/municipios" and create a tidy tibble.
# Intermediate and final outputs are stored in "data/geo".

# Read in TIFs and merge them with the SHP file using `raster::extract`. Creates
# a list of extracted dataframes and stores it as "geo_extract_raw.rds".
# Very computationally intensive, done via `parallel::parLapply` if available.

# Tidy the tibble, (create a long table) and store it as "geo_df_long.rds".

# of values extracted from the land use change maps.
# Stores an sf-tibble as "shp.rds".

# Prepare SPEI data -------------------------------------------------------

# Read in NCDF raster files from "data/spei", merge them with IDs from the maps
# of political boundaries found in "data/municipios" and create a tidy tibble.
# Intermediate and final outputs are stored in "data/geo". The desired
# SPEI timescale is set in the scripts.

# Read in NCDFs and merge them with the SHP file using weighted

# Outputs are stored as RDS files under "data/tab".

# Merge datasets ----------------------------------------------------------

# Merge RDS files from the previous steps, derive variables of interest, explore

# Store the resulting tibble as "data/tab/tab.rds".

# Results are stored as RDA files under "data/models_%EFFECT.rda", where effect
# corresponds to the treatment of fixed effects.
